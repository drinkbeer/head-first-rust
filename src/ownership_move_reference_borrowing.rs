Here are some of the types that implement Copy trait:

    - All the integer types, such as u32.
    - The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
    - All the floating point types, such as f64.
    - The character type, char.
    - Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement Copy. For example, (i32, i32) implements Copy, but (i32, String) does not.

With copy trait, it will be copied when it's assigned to another variable, so the ownership is not transferred.
